        "Notes" "Changes in 5.4.0"
        "Notes" "- Default stac_max_connections_from_ip to 0, only enable it if you need it because StAC isn't catching bots. If this happens, open an issue on the GitHub!"
        "Notes" "- Default stac_kick_unauthed_clients to 0, only enable if you're having issues with cheating unauthenticated players."
        "Notes" "- Better prevention of already banned clients from joining servers and spamming notifications to Discord, thank you Kaiga with Uncletopia for the report."
        "Notes" "- Tightened up some checks."
        "Notes" "- StAC now better ignores laggy clients."
        "Notes" "- StAC no longer whines about an invalid file handle on server start."
