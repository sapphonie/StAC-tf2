        "Notes"     "https://github.com/sapphonie/StAC-tf2/pull/139"
        "Notes"     "Of note: StAC now requires 4 extensions and some gamedata to run, to prevent the latest exploits, including server crashers and admin spoofing. These will be automatically downloaded by Updater."
        "Notes"     "- 6.0.1 properly disables support for servers with more than 32 human players instead of throwing errors and continuing to run."
